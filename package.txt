npm i tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite(completely add the react at the vite.config.js file after installing this package)
 npm i @radix-ui/react-toast class-variance-authority clsx
 npm i lucide-react react-router-dom tailwind-merge


create your custom tailwind styling in index.css file using @theme{}

creating utility class to add styling to a class name

@apply:- this is used to apply a tailwind base css style,you can also apply variables you have defined in the theme
--card:- the -- is a variable in the css theme 

after setting up the styles on the index.css file, create the toogle function which is a component
now making the website know i prefer darkmode by using local storage in the themetoggle function
use tailwind merge library to style the toogle button:- this is just so we can write lots of classes for styling and still be able to click and continue write the classes on a new line check-out themetoggle button
